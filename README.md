### Details on the Datasets I Selected
I selected datasets from Stony Brook Medicine and Memorial Healthcare System - Miramar Hospital. Both of the datasets focus on the hospital's standard charges for services. The dataset from Stony Brook Medicine includes columns such as code, description, type, package/line_level, gross charge, discounted cash price, and other columns that focused on the standard charges of certain insurance providers and plan types. Stony Brook Medicine had a wide variety of insurance providers. The other dataset was focused on Memorial Hospital Miramar.
